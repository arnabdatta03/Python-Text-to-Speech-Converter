# Python-Text-to-Speech-Converter
In this python code which text we write the code automatically speak that lines ....

# Working principle
In this code we use the core python language and here we also use the module package system in python in this project we use basically 2 files one file is Robo.py and also one file is Robo_complete.py in the Robo file we define the welcome msg and speak the masg with printing that who is define the code segment ...

and the second file Robo_complete.py which is main file where we difine the text to speak convert part here we import first Robo.py to the help of import function then write rest of code portition in the while loop we difine the rest of code that the code is run infinitelly.. Next when our work is complete we need to stop the code and exit from it that causes we reflect one button if you enter the that button the program will automatically exit and last wish u and exit ...

I may suggest of all to use it then review or commit if any changes are neede in this code or any modification is need , so run it and enjoy ...

Important things two files are mandatory to run this program cause unless of one file it is not run  so be carefull ..
